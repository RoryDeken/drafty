# Drafty

Welcome to Drafty, a front-end that is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) to consume and interact with an API for drafting players or teams for fantasy leagues.
 

# Getting Started

Make sure [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/] is installed. Using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is recommended to be able to pin correct node versions but not necessary.

Get set up locally in two steps:

```git clone https://github.com/RoryDeken/drafty.git```

```cd drafty```

```npm install```

```npm start```

You should now see the front-end running at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
